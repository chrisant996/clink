       rreeaaddlliinnee  reads a line from the terminal and return it, using pprroommpptt as
       a prompt.  If pprroommpptt is NNUULLLL or the empty string, rreeaaddlliinnee does not is-
       sue a prompt.  The line  returned  is  allocated  with  _m_a_l_l_o_c(3);  the
       caller  must  free  it  when finished.  The line returned has the final
       newline removed, so only the text of the line remains.  Since it's pos-
       sible to enter characters into the line while quoting them  to  disable
       any  rreeaaddlliinnee  editing function they might normally have, this line may
       include embedded newlines and other special characters.

       rreeaaddlliinnee offers editing capabilities while the  user  is  entering  the
       line.   By  default,  the line editing commands are similar to those of
       emacs.  A vi-style line editing interface is also available.

       This manual page describes only the most basic use of  rreeaaddlliinnee.   Much
       more  functionality  is available; see _T_h_e _G_N_U _R_e_a_d_l_i_n_e _L_i_b_r_a_r_y and _T_h_e

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       rreeaaddlliinnee returns the text of the line read.  A blank line  returns  the
       empty string.  If EEOOFF is encountered while reading a line, and the line
       is  empty,  rreeaaddlliinnee  returns NNUULLLL.  If an EEOOFF is read with a non-empty
       line, it is treated as a newline.

NNOOTTAATTIIOONN
       This section uses Emacs-style editing concepts and  uses  its  notation
       for  keystrokes.   Control  keys  are denoted by C-_k_e_y, e.g., C-n means
       Control-N.  Similarly, _m_e_t_a keys are denoted by  M-_k_e_y,  so  M-x  means
       Meta-X.  The Meta key is often labeled "Alt" or "Option".

       On  keyboards  without a _M_e_t_a key, M-_x means ESC _x, i.e., press and re-
       lease the Escape key, then press and release the _x  key,  in  sequence.
       This  makes  ESC the _m_e_t_a _p_r_e_f_i_x.  The combination M-C-_x means ESC Con-
       trol-_x: press and release the Escape key, then press and hold the  Con-
       trol key while pressing the _x key, then release both.

       On  some  keyboards, the Meta key modifier produces characters with the
       eighth bit (0200) set.  You can use  the  eennaabbllee--mmeettaa--kkeeyy  variable  to
       control  whether  or  not  it does this, if the keyboard allows it.  On
       many others, the terminal or terminal emulator  converts  the  metafied
       key  to a key sequence beginning with ESC as described in the preceding
       paragraph.

       If your _M_e_t_a key produces a key sequence with the ESC meta prefix,  you
       can  make M-_k_e_y key bindings you specify (see RReeaaddlliinnee KKeeyy BBiinnddiinnggss be-
       low) do the same thing by setting the ffoorrccee--mmeettaa--pprreeffiixx variable.

       RReeaaddlliinnee commands may be given numeric _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s, which normally act as
       a repeat count.  Sometimes, however, it is the  sign  of  the  argument
       that  is  significant.   Passing  a negative argument to a command that
       acts in the forward direction (e.g., kkiillll--lliinnee) makes that command  act
       in  a backward direction.  Commands whose behavior with arguments devi-
       ates from this are noted below.

       The _p_o_i_n_t is the current cursor position, and _m_a_r_k refers  to  a  saved
       cursor position.  The text between the point and mark is referred to as
       the _r_e_g_i_o_n.

       When  a command is described as _k_i_l_l_i_n_g text, the text deleted is saved
       for possible future retrieval (_y_a_n_k_i_n_g).  The killed text is saved in a
       _k_i_l_l _r_i_n_g.  Consecutive kills accumulate  the  deleted  text  into  one
       unit, which can be yanked all at once.  Commands which do not kill text
       separate the chunks of text on the kill ring.

IINNIITTIIAALLIIZZAATTIIOONN FFIILLEE
       RReeaaddlliinnee  is  customized  by putting commands in an initialization file
       (the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file).  The name of this file is taken from the  value  of
       the  IINNPPUUTTRRCC  environment variable.  If that variable is unset, the de-
       fault is _~_/_._i_n_p_u_t_r_c.  If that file  does not exist or cannot  be  read,
       rreeaaddlliinnee looks for _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_p_u_t_r_c.  When a program that uses the rreeaaddlliinnee
       library  starts up, rreeaaddlliinnee reads the initialization file and sets the
       key bindings and variables found there, before reading any user input.

       There are only a few basic constructs  allowed  in  the  inputrc  file.
       Blank lines are ignored.  Lines beginning with a ## are comments.  Lines
       beginning with a $$ indicate conditional constructs.  Other lines denote
       key bindings and variable settings.

       The  default  key-bindings  in  this  document may be changed using key
       binding commands in the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file.  Programs that use  this  library
       may add their own commands and bindings.

       For example, placing

              M-Control-u: universal-argument
       or
              C-Meta-u: universal-argument

       into  the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c would make M-C-u execute the rreeaaddlliinnee command _u_n_i_v_e_r_-
       _s_a_l_-_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t.

       Key bindings may contain the following symbolic character  names:  _D_E_L,
       _E_S_C,  _E_S_C_A_P_E,  _L_F_D,  _N_E_W_L_I_N_E,  _R_E_T, _R_E_T_U_R_N, _R_U_B_O_U_T (a destructive back-
       space), _S_P_A_C_E, _S_P_C, and _T_A_B.

       In addition to command names, rreeaaddlliinnee allows keys to  be  bound  to  a
       string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a _m_a_c_r_o).  The differ-
       ence  between a macro and a command is that a macro is enclosed in sin-
       gle or double quotes.

   KKeeyy BBiinnddiinnggss
       The syntax for controlling key bindings in the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file is  simple.
       All  that is required is the name of the command or the text of a macro
       and a key sequence to which it should be bound.  The key  sequence  may
       be  specified in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with
       _M_e_t_a_- or _C_o_n_t_r_o_l_- prefixes, or as a key sequence  composed  of  one  or
       more  characters  enclosed in double quotes.  The key sequence and name
       are separated by a colon.  There can be no whitespace between the  name
       and the colon.

       When using the form kkeeyynnaammee:_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e or _m_a_c_r_o, _k_e_y_n_a_m_e is the name
       of a key spelled out in English.  For example:

              Control-u: universal-argument
              Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
              Control-o: "> output"

       In  the above example, _C_-_u is bound to the function uunniivveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt,
       _M_-_D_E_L is bound to the function bbaacckkwwaarrdd--kkiillll--wwoorrdd, and _C_-_o is bound  to
       run  the macro expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the
       text "> output" into the line).

       In the second form, ""kkeeyysseeqq"":_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e  or  _m_a_c_r_o,  kkeeyysseeqq  differs
       from  kkeeyynnaammee above in that strings denoting an entire key sequence may
       be specified by placing the sequence within double  quotes.   Some  GNU
       Emacs  style  key escapes can be used, as in the following example, but
       none of the symbolic character names are recognized.

              "\C-u": universal-argument
              "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
              "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"

       In this example, _C_-_u is again bound to the function uunniivveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt.
       _C_-_x _C_-_r is bound to the function rree--rreeaadd--iinniitt--ffiillee, and _E_S_C _[ _1 _1 _~  is
       bound to insert the text "Function Key 1".

       The  full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences available when speci-
       fying key sequences is
              \\CC--    A control prefix.
              \\MM--    Adding the meta prefix or converting the following  char-
                     acter  to  a  meta  character,  as  described below under
                     ffoorrccee--mmeettaa--pprreeffiixx.
              \\ee     An escape character.
              \\\\     Backslash.
              \\""     Literal ", a double quote.
              \\''     Literal ', a single quote.

       In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a  second  set  of
       backslash escapes is available:
              \\aa     alert (bell)
              \\bb     backspace
              \\dd     delete
              \\ff     form feed
              \\nn     newline
              \\rr     carriage return
              \\tt     horizontal tab
              \\vv     vertical tab
              \\_n_n_n   The  eight-bit  character  whose value is the octal value
                     _n_n_n (one to three digits).
              \\xx_H_H   The eight-bit character whose value  is  the  hexadecimal
                     value _H_H (one or two hex digits).

       When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be used
       to indicate a macro definition.  Unquoted text is assumed to be a func-
       tion  name.   The backslash escapes described above are expanded in the
       macro body.  Backslash quotes any other character in  the  macro  text,
       including " and '.

       BBaasshh  will display or modify the current rreeaaddlliinnee key bindings with the
       bbiinndd builtin command.  The --oo eemmaaccss or --oo vvii options to the sseett builtin
       change the editing mode during interactive use.  Other  programs  using
       this  library  provide  similar mechanisms.  A user may always edit the
       _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file and have rreeaaddlliinnee re-read it if a program does not provide
       any other means to incorporate new bindings.

   VVaarriiaabblleess
       RReeaaddlliinnee has variables that can be used to further customize its behav-
       ior.  A variable may be set in the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file with a statement of the
       form

              sseett _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_-_n_a_m_e _v_a_l_u_e

       Except where noted, rreeaaddlliinnee variables can take the values  OOnn  or  OOffff
       (without  regard  to  case).   Unrecognized variable names are ignored.
       When rreeaaddlliinnee reads a variable value, empty or null values, "on" (case-
       insensitive), and "1" are equivalent  to  OOnn.   All  other  values  are
       equivalent to OOffff.

       The variables and their default values are:

       aaccttiivvee--rreeggiioonn--ssttaarrtt--ccoolloorr
              A  string  variable  that controls the text color and background
              when displaying the text in the active region (see the  descrip-
              tion  of eennaabbllee--aaccttiivvee--rreeggiioonn below).  This string must not take
              up any physical character positions on the display, so it should
              consist only of terminal escape sequences.  It is output to  the
              terminal  before displaying the text in the active region.  This
              variable is reset to the default  value  whenever  the  terminal
              type  changes.   The  default  value is the string that puts the
              terminal in standout mode, as obtained from the terminal's  ter-
              minfo description.  A sample value might be "\e[01;33m".
       aaccttiivvee--rreeggiioonn--eenndd--ccoolloorr
              A  string  variable  that  "undoes"  the  effects  of aaccttiivvee--rree--
              ggiioonn--ssttaarrtt--ccoolloorr and restores "normal" terminal display  appear-
              ance  after  displaying  text in the active region.  This string
              must not take up any physical character positions  on  the  dis-
              play,  so  it  should consist only of terminal escape sequences.
              It is output to the terminal after displaying the  text  in  the
              active  region.   This  variable  is  reset to the default value
              whenever the terminal type changes.  The default  value  is  the
              string  that  restores  the  terminal from standout mode, as ob-
              tained from the terminal's terminfo description.  A sample value
              might be "\e[0m".
       bbeellll--ssttyyllee ((aauuddiibbllee))
              Controls what happens when rreeaaddlliinnee wants to ring  the  terminal
              bell.  If set to nnoonnee, rreeaaddlliinnee never rings the bell.  If set to
              vviissiibbllee,  rreeaaddlliinnee  uses a visible bell if one is available.  If
              set to aauuddiibbllee, rreeaaddlliinnee attempts to ring the terminal's bell.
       bbiinndd--ttttyy--ssppeecciiaall--cchhaarrss ((OOnn))
              If set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee attempts to bind the  control  characters
              that  are  treated  specially by the kernel's terminal driver to
              their rreeaaddlliinnee equivalents.  These override the default rreeaaddlliinnee
              bindings described here.  Type "stty -a" at a bbaasshh prompt to see
              your current terminal settings, including  the  special  control
              characters (usually cccchhaarrss).
       bblliinnkk--mmaattcchhiinngg--ppaarreenn ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee attempts to briefly move the cursor to an
              opening parenthesis when a closing parenthesis is inserted.
       ccoolloorreedd--ccoommpplleettiioonn--pprreeffiixx ((OOffff))
              If  set  to  OOnn, when listing completions, rreeaaddlliinnee displays the
              common prefix of the set of possible completions using a differ-
              ent color.  The color definitions are taken from  the  value  of
              the LLSS__CCOOLLOORRSS environment variable.  If there is a color defini-
              tion  in $$LLSS__CCOOLLOORRSS for the custom suffix "readline-colored-com-
              pletion-prefix", rreeaaddlliinnee uses this color for the common  prefix
              instead of its default.
       ccoolloorreedd--ssttaattss ((OOffff))
              If  set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee displays possible completions using dif-
              ferent colors to indicate their file type.   The  color  defini-
              tions  are  taken  from  the  value of the LLSS__CCOOLLOORRSS environment
              variable.
       ccoommmmeenntt--bbeeggiinn (("##"))
              The string that the  rreeaaddlliinnee  iinnsseerrtt--ccoommmmeenntt  command  inserts.
              This  command  is bound to MM--## in emacs mode and to ## in vi com-
              mand mode.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--ddiissppllaayy--wwiiddtthh ((--11))
              The number of screen columns used to  display  possible  matches
              when  performing completion.  The value is ignored if it is less
              than 0 or greater than the terminal screen width.  A value of  0
              causes  matches to be displayed one per line.  The default value
              is -1.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--iiggnnoorree--ccaassee ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee performs filename matching and completion
              in a case-insensitive fashion.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--mmaapp--ccaassee ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, and ccoommpplleettiioonn--iiggnnoorree--ccaassee  is  enabled,  rreeaaddlliinnee
              treats  hyphens  (_-) and underscores (__) as equivalent when per-
              forming case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--pprreeffiixx--ddiissppllaayy--lleennggtthh ((00))
              The maximum length in characters of the common prefix of a  list
              of  possible completions that is displayed without modification.
              When set to a value greater than zero, rreeaaddlliinnee replaces  common
              prefixes longer than this value with an ellipsis when displaying
              possible completions.  If a completion begins with a period, and
              eeaaddlliinnee  is  completing filenames, it uses three underscores in-
              stead of an ellipsis.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--qquueerryy--iitteemmss ((110000))
              This determines when the user is queried about viewing the  num-
              ber  of  possible  completions generated by the ppoossssiibbllee--ccoommppllee--
              ttiioonnss command.  It may be set to any integer value greater  than
              or  equal  to  zero.   If  the number of possible completions is
              greater than or equal to the value of  this  variable,  rreeaaddlliinnee
              asks  whether  or  not  the  user wishes to view them; otherwise
              rreeaaddlliinnee simply lists them on the terminal.  A zero value  means
              rreeaaddlliinnee should never ask; negative values are treated as zero.
       ccoonnvveerrtt--mmeettaa ((OOnn))
              If  set  to  OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee converts characters it reads that have
              the eighth bit set to an ASCII  key  sequence  by  clearing  the
              eighth bit and prefixing it with an escape character (converting
              the  character to have the meta prefix).  The default is _O_n, but
              rreeaaddlliinnee sets it to _O_f_f if the locale contains characters  whose
              encodings may include bytes with the eighth bit set.  This vari-
              able  is  dependent  on  the  LLCC__CCTTYYPPEE  locale category, and may
              change if the locale changes.  This variable  also  affects  key
              bindings; see the description of ffoorrccee--mmeettaa--pprreeffiixx below.
       ddiissaabbllee--ccoommpplleettiioonn ((OOffff))
              If  set  to  OOnn,  rreeaaddlliinnee inhibits word completion.  Completion
              characters are inserted into the line as if they had been mapped
              to sseellff--iinnsseerrtt.
       eecchhoo--ccoonnttrrooll--cchhaarraacctteerrss ((OOnn))
              When set to OOnn, on operating systems that indicate they  support
              it, rreeaaddlliinnee echoes a character corresponding to a signal gener-
              ated from the keyboard.
       eeddiittiinngg--mmooddee ((eemmaaccss))
              Controls  whether rreeaaddlliinnee uses a set of key bindings similar to
              _E_m_a_c_s or _v_i.  eeddiittiinngg--mmooddee can be set to either eemmaaccss or vvii.
       eemmaaccss--mmooddee--ssttrriinngg ((@@))
              If the _s_h_o_w_-_m_o_d_e_-_i_n_-_p_r_o_m_p_t variable is enabled, this  string  is
              displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt
              when emacs editing mode is active.  The value is expanded like a
              key  binding, so the standard set of meta- and control- prefixes
              and backslash escape sequences is available.  The \1 and \2  es-
              capes  begin and end sequences of non-printing characters, which
              can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into  the  mode
              string.
       eennaabbllee--aaccttiivvee--rreeggiioonn ((OOnn))
              When  this  variable  is set to _O_n, rreeaaddlliinnee allows certain com-
              mands to designate the region as _a_c_t_i_v_e.  When the region is ac-
              tive, rreeaaddlliinnee highlights the text in the region using the value
              of the aaccttiivvee--rreeggiioonn--ssttaarrtt--ccoolloorr variable, which defaults to the
              string that enables the terminal's standout  mode.   The  active
              region shows the text inserted by bracketed-paste and any match-
              ing  text  found  by  incremental  and  non-incremental  history
              searches.
       eennaabbllee--bbrraacckkeetteedd--ppaassttee ((OOnn))
              When set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee configures the terminal to insert  each
              paste  into the editing buffer as a single string of characters,
              instead of treating each character as if it had been  read  from
              the  keyboard.  This is called _b_r_a_c_k_e_t_e_d_-_p_a_s_t_e _m_o_d_e; it prevents
              rreeaaddlliinnee from executing any editing commands bound  to  key  se-
              quences appearing in the pasted text.
       eennaabbllee--kkeeyyppaadd ((OOffff))
              When  set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee tries to enable the application keypad
              when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable  the  arrow
              keys.
       eennaabbllee--mmeettaa--kkeeyy ((OOnn))
              When  set  to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee tries to enable any meta modifier key
              the terminal claims to support.  On many terminals, the Meta key
              is used to send eight-bit characters; this variable  checks  for
              the  terminal  capability that indicates the terminal can enable
              and disable a mode that sets  the  eighth  bit  of  a  character
              (0200)  if the Meta key is held down when the character is typed
              (a meta character).
       eexxppaanndd--ttiillddee ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee performs tilde expansion when it attempts
              word completion.
       ffoorrccee--mmeettaa--pprreeffiixx ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee modifies its behavior  when  binding  key
              sequences  containing  \M-  or Meta- (see KKeeyy BBiinnddiinnggss above) by
              converting a key sequence of the form \M-_C or Meta-_C to the two-
              character  sequence  EESSCC  _C  (adding  the  meta   prefix).    If
              ffoorrccee--mmeettaa--pprreeffiixx is set to OOffff (the default), rreeaaddlliinnee uses the
              value  of the ccoonnvveerrtt--mmeettaa variable to determine whether to per-
              form this conversion: if ccoonnvveerrtt--mmeettaa is OOnn,  rreeaaddlliinnee  performs
              the  conversion described above; if it is OOffff, rreeaaddlliinnee converts
              _C to a meta character by setting the eighth bit (0200).
       hhiissttoorryy--pprreesseerrvvee--ppooiinntt ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, the history code attempts to place  point  at  the
              same  location on each history line retrieved with pprreevviioouuss--hhiiss--
              ttoorryy or nneexxtt--hhiissttoorryy.
       hhiissttoorryy--ssiizzee ((uunnsseett))
              Set the maximum number of history entries saved in  the  history
              list.   If set to zero, any existing history entries are deleted
              and no new entries are saved.  If set to a value less than zero,
              the number of history entries is not limited.  By  default,  the
              number  of history entries is not limited.  Setting _h_i_s_t_o_r_y_-_s_i_z_e
              to a non-numeric value will set the maximum  number  of  history
              entries to 500.

              Setting this variable to OOnn makes rreeaaddlliinnee use a single line for
              display,  scrolling  the  input  horizontally on a single screen
              line when it becomes longer than the screen  width  rather  than
              wrapping  to  a new line.  This setting is automatically enabled
              for terminals of height 1.
       iinnppuutt--mmeettaa ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee enables eight-bit input (that is, it does
              not clear the eighth bit in the characters it reads), regardless
              of what the terminal claims it can support.  The default is _O_f_f,
              but rreeaaddlliinnee sets it to _O_n if  the  locale  contains  characters
              whose encodings may include bytes with the eighth bit set.  This
              variable  is  dependent on the LLCC__CCTTYYPPEE locale category, and its
              value may change if the locale changes.  The name mmeettaa--ffllaagg is a
              synonym for iinnppuutt--mmeettaa.
       iisseeaarrcchh--tteerrmmiinnaattoorrss (("CC--[[CC--jj"))
              The string of characters that should  terminate  an  incremental
              search  without  subsequently  executing the character as a com-
              mand.  If this variable has not been given a value, the  charac-
              ters _E_S_C and CC--jj terminate an incremental search.
       kkeeyymmaapp ((eemmaaccss))
              Set  the current rreeaaddlliinnee keymap.  The set of valid keymap names
              is _e_m_a_c_s_, _e_m_a_c_s_-_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_, _e_m_a_c_s_-_m_e_t_a_,  _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_t_l_x_,  _v_i_,  _v_i_-_c_o_m_-
              _m_a_n_d,  and  _v_i_-_i_n_s_e_r_t.  _v_i is equivalent to _v_i_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d; _e_m_a_c_s is
              equivalent to _e_m_a_c_s_-_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d.  The default value is  _e_m_a_c_s;  the
              value of eeddiittiinngg--mmooddee also affects the default keymap.
       kkeeyysseeqq--ttiimmeeoouutt ((550000))
              Specifies  the  duration rreeaaddlliinnee will wait for a character when
              reading an ambiguous key sequence (one that can form a  complete
              key sequence using the input read so far, or can take additional
              input  to complete a longer key sequence).  If rreeaaddlliinnee does not
              receive any input within the timeout, it uses  the  shorter  but
              complete  key sequence.  The value is specified in milliseconds,
              so a value of 1000 means that rreeaaddlliinnee will wait one second  for
              additional  input.  If this variable is set to a value less than
              or equal to zero, or to a non-numeric value, rreeaaddlliinnee waits  un-
              til  another key is pressed to decide which key sequence to com-
              plete.
       mmaarrkk--ddiirreeccttoorriieess ((OOnn))
              If set to OOnn, completed directory names have a slash appended.
       mmaarrkk--mmooddiiffiieedd--lliinneess ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee displays history  lines  that  have  been
              modified with a preceding asterisk (**).

              If set to OOnn, completed names which are symbolic links to direc-
              tories  have  a slash appended, subject to the value of mmaarrkk--ddii--

       mmaattcchh--hhiiddddeenn--ffiilleess ((OOnn))
              This variable, when set to OOnn, forces rreeaaddlliinnee  to  match  files
              whose  names  begin  with  a "."  (hidden files) when performing
              filename completion.  If set to OOffff, the user must  include  the
              leading "."  in the filename to be completed.

              If  set to OOnn, menu completion displays the common prefix of the
              list of possible completions (which may be empty) before cycling
              through the list.
       oouuttppuutt--mmeettaa ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee displays characters with the  eighth  bit
              set  directly  rather  than  as a meta-prefixed escape sequence.
              The default is _O_f_f, but rreeaaddlliinnee sets it to  _O_n  if  the  locale
              contains  characters  whose encodings may include bytes with the
              eighth bit set.  This variable is dependent on the LLCC__CCTTYYPPEE  lo-
              cale category, and its value may change if the locale changes.
       ppaaggee--ccoommpplleettiioonnss ((OOnn))
              If set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee uses an internal pager resembling _m_o_r_e(1)
              to display a screenful of possible completions at a time.

              If set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee will undo all changes  to  history  lines
              before  returning  when executing aacccceepptt--lliinnee.  By default, his-
              tory lines may be modified  and  retain  individual  undo  lists
              across calls to rreeaaddlliinnee(()).

              If  set to OOnn, rreeaaddlliinnee performs incremental and non-incremental
              history list searches in a case-insensitive fashion.

              This alters the default behavior of  the  completion  functions.
              If set to OOnn, words which have more than one possible completion
              cause  the  matches  to be listed immediately instead of ringing
              the bell.

              This alters the default behavior of the completion functions  in
              a fashion similar to sshhooww--aallll--iiff--aammbbiigguuoouuss.  If set to OOnn, words
              which  have more than one possible completion without any possi-
              ble partial completion (the possible completions don't  share  a
              common  prefix)  cause  the matches to be listed immediately in-
              stead of ringing the bell.

              If set to OOnn, add a string to the beginning of the prompt  indi-
              cating  the  editing  mode:  emacs, vi command, or vi insertion.
              The mode strings are user-settable (e.g., _e_m_a_c_s_-_m_o_d_e_-_s_t_r_i_n_g).

              If set to OOnn, this alters the default completion  behavior  when
              inserting  a  single match into the line.  It's only active when
              performing completion in the middle  of  a  word.   If  enabled,
              rreeaaddlliinnee  does  not  insert  characters from the completion that
              match characters after point in the  word  being  completed,  so
              portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.

              If  the  _s_h_o_w_-_m_o_d_e_-_i_n_-_p_r_o_m_p_t variable is enabled, this string is
              displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt
              when vi editing mode is active and in command mode.   The  value
              is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and
              control-  prefixes  and backslash escape sequences is available.
              The \1 and \2 escapes begin and end  sequences  of  non-printing
              characters,  which  can  be used to embed a terminal control se-
              quence into the mode string.

   CCoonnddiittiioonnaall CCoonnssttrruuccttss
       RReeaaddlliinnee implements a facility similar in  spirit  to  the  conditional
       compilation  features  of  the C preprocessor which allows key bindings
       and variable settings to be performed as the result  of  tests.   There
       are four parser directives available.

       $$iiff    The  $$iiff construct allows bindings to be made based on the edit-
              ing mode, the terminal being  used,  or  the  application  using
              rreeaaddlliinnee.   The text of the test, after any comparison operator,
              extends to the end of the line; unless otherwise noted, no char-
              acters are required to isolate it.

              mmooddee   The mmooddee== form of the  $$iiff  directive  is  used  to  test
                     whether  rreeaaddlliinnee  is  in  emacs or vi mode.  This may be
                     used in conjunction with the sseett kkeeyymmaapp command, for  in-
                     stance,   to  set  bindings  in  the  _e_m_a_c_s_-_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d  and
                     _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_t_l_x keymaps only if rreeaaddlliinnee is  starting  out  in
                     emacs mode.

              tteerrmm   The  tteerrmm==  form may be used to include terminal-specific
                     key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by
                     the terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side
                     of the == is tested against both the full name of the ter-
                     minal and the portion of the  terminal  name  before  the
                     first  --.   This  allows  _x_t_e_r_m  to  match both _x_t_e_r_m and
                     _x_t_e_r_m_-_2_5_6_c_o_l_o_r, for instance.

              vveerrssiioonn
                     The vveerrssiioonn test  may  be  used  to  perform  comparisons
                     against  specific rreeaaddlliinnee versions.  The vveerrssiioonn expands
                     to the current rreeaaddlliinnee version.  The set  of  comparison
                     operators  includes  ==,  (and  ====), !!==, <<==, >>==, <<, and >>.
                     The version number supplied on the right side of the  op-
                     erator  consists  of  a major version number, an optional
                     decimal point, and an optional minor version (e.g., 77..11).
                     If the minor version is omitted, it defaults to  00.   The
                     operator  may  be  separated  from the string vveerrssiioonn and
                     from the version number argument by whitespace.

              _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n
                     The _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n construct is used to include application-
                     specific settings.  Each program using the  rreeaaddlliinnee  li-
                     brary  sets  the  _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _n_a_m_e, and an initialization
                     file can test for a particular value.  This could be used
                     to bind key sequences to functions useful for a  specific
                     program.   For instance, the following command adds a key
                     sequence that quotes the  current  or  previous  word  in
                     bbaasshh:

                     $$iiff Bash
                     # Quote the current or previous word
                     "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
                     $$eennddiiff

              _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
                     The _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e construct provides simple equality tests for
                     rreeaaddlliinnee  variables and values.  The permitted comparison
                     operators are _=, _=_=, and _!_=.  The variable name  must  be
                     separated from the comparison operator by whitespace; the
                     operator  may  be  separated  from the value on the right
                     hand side by whitespace.  String  and  boolean  variables
                     may  be tested.  Boolean variables must be tested against
                     the values _o_n and _o_f_f.

       $$eellssee  Commands in this branch of the $$iiff directive are executed if the
              test fails.

       $$eennddiiff This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an $$iiff
              command.

       $$iinncclluuddee
              This directive takes a single filename as an argument and  reads
              commands and key bindings from that file.  For example, the fol-
              lowing directive would read _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_p_u_t_r_c:

              $$iinncclluuddee  _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_p_u_t_r_c

SSEEAARRCCHHIINNGG
       RReeaaddlliinnee  provides  commands  for searching through the command history
       for lines containing a specified string.  There are two  search  modes:
       _i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t_a_l and _n_o_n_-_i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t_a_l.

       Incremental  searches  begin  before  the  user has finished typing the
       search string.  As each character of the search string is typed,  rreeaadd--
       lliinnee displays the next entry from the history matching the string typed
       so  far.   An  incremental  search  requires only as many characters as
       needed to find the desired history entry.   When  using  emacs  editing
       mode,  type  CC--rr  to  search  backward  in the history for a particular
       string.  Typing CC--ss searches forward through the history.  The  charac-
       ters  present in the value of the iisseeaarrcchh--tteerrmmiinnaattoorrss variable are used
       to terminate an incremental search.  If that variable has not been  as-
       signed  a  value,  _E_S_C  and  CC--jj  terminate an incremental search.  CC--gg
       aborts an incremental search and restores the original line.  When  the
       search  is  terminated,  the history entry containing the search string
       becomes the current line.

       To find other matching entries in the history list, type CC--rr or CC--ss  as
       appropriate.   This searches backward or forward in the history for the
       next entry matching the search string typed so far.  Any other key  se-
       quence  bound  to a rreeaaddlliinnee command terminates the search and executes
       that command.  For instance, a newline terminates the  search  and  ac-
       cepts the line, thereby executing the command from the history list.  A
       movement  command  will  terminate the search, make the last line found
       the current line, and begin editing.

       RReeaaddlliinnee remembers the last incremental search string.  If two CC--rrs are
       typed without any intervening characters defining a new search  string,
       rreeaaddlliinnee uses any remembered search string.

       Non-incremental  searches read the entire search string before starting
       to search for matching history entries.  The search string may be typed
       by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.

EEDDIITTIINNGG CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
       The following is a list of the names of the commands  and  the  default
       key sequences to which they are bound.  Command names without an accom-
       panying key sequence are unbound by default.

       In the following descriptions, _p_o_i_n_t refers to the current cursor posi-
       tion,  and  _m_a_r_k refers to a cursor position saved by the sseett--mmaarrkk com-
       mand.  The text between the point and mark is referred to  as  the  _r_e_-
       _g_i_o_n.  RReeaaddlliinnee has the concept of an _a_c_t_i_v_e _r_e_g_i_o_n: when the region is
       active, rreeaaddlliinnee redisplay highlights the region using the value of the
       aaccttiivvee--rreeggiioonn--ssttaarrtt--ccoolloorr  variable.  The eennaabbllee--aaccttiivvee--rreeggiioonn variable
       turns this on and off.  Several commands  set  the  region  to  active;
       those are noted below.

              call  with  aadddd__hhiissttoorryy(()).   If  the  line is a modified history
              line, restore the history line to its original state.
       pprreevviioouuss--hhiissttoorryy ((CC--pp))
              Fetch the previous command from the history list, moving back in
              the list.  This may also be bound to the up arrow  key  on  some
              keyboards.
       nneexxtt--hhiissttoorryy ((CC--nn))
              Fetch  the next command from the history list, moving forward in

       eenndd--ooff--hhiissttoorryy ((MM-->>))
              Move  to  the end of the input history, i.e., the line currently
              being entered.

              Accept the current line for return to the calling application as
              if a newline had been entered, and fetch the next line  relative
              to the current line from the history for editing.  A numeric ar-
              gument,  if supplied, specifies the history entry to use instead
              of the current line.
       ffeettcchh--hhiissttoorryy
              With a numeric argument, fetch that entry from the history  list
              and make it the current line.  Without an argument, move back to
              the first entry in the history list.

              Search  backward  starting  at  the current line and moving "up"
              through the  history  as  necessary.   This  is  an  incremental
              search.   This  command  sets the region to the matched text and
              activates the region.

              Search forward starting at the current line  and  moving  "down"
              through  the  history  as  necessary.   This  is  an incremental
              search.  This command sets the region to the  matched  text  and

              Search forward  through  the  history  using  a  non-incremental
              search for a string supplied by the user.  The search string may
              match anywhere in a history line.
       hhiissttoorryy--sseeaarrcchh--bbaacckkwwaarrdd
              Search backward through the history for the string of characters
              between the start of the current line and the point.  The search
              string must match at the beginning of a history line.  This is a
              non-incremental search.  This may be bound to the Page Up key on
              some keyboards.
       hhiissttoorryy--sseeaarrcchh--ffoorrwwaarrdd
              Search  forward through the history for the string of characters
              between the start of the current line and the point.  The search
              string must match at the beginning of a history line.  This is a

              Search backward through the history for the string of characters
              between the start of the current line and the point.  The search
              string  may match anywhere in a history line.  This is a non-in-

              Search forward through the history for the string of  characters
              between the start of the current line and the point.  The search
              string  may match anywhere in a history line.  This is a non-in-

       yyaannkk--nntthh--aarrgg ((MM--CC--yy))
              Insert the first argument to the previous command  (usually  the
              second word on the previous line) at point.  With an argument _n,
              insert  the _nth word from the previous command (the words in the
              previous command begin with word 0).  A  negative  argument  in-
              serts  the  _nth word from the end of the previous command.  Once
              the argument _n is computed, this uses the history expansion  fa-
              cilities  to extract the _nth word, as if the "!_n" history expan-
              sion had been specified.
       yyaannkk--llaasstt--aarrgg ((MM--..,, MM--__))
              Insert the last argument to the previous command (the last  word
              of the previous history entry).  With a numeric argument, behave
              exactly  like  yyaannkk--nntthh--aarrgg.   Successive calls to yyaannkk--llaasstt--aarrgg
              move back through the history list, inserting the last word  (or
              the  word  specified  by the argument to the first call) of each
              line in turn.  Any numeric argument supplied to these successive
              calls determines the direction to move through the  history.   A
              negative  argument  switches  the  direction through the history
              (back or forward).  This uses the history  expansion  facilities
              to  extract  the last word, as if the "!$" history expansion had
              been specified.

   CCoommmmaannddss ffoorr CChhaannggiinngg TTeexxtt
       _e_n_d_-_o_f_-_f_i_l_e ((uussuuaallllyy CC--dd))
              The character indicating end-of-file as  set,  for  example,  by
              _s_t_t_y(1).  If this character is read when there are no characters
              on the line, and point is at the beginning of the line, rreeaaddlliinnee
              interprets it as the end of input and returns EEOOFF.
       ddeelleettee--cchhaarr ((CC--dd))
              Delete the character at point.  If this function is bound to the
              same character as the tty EEOOFF character, as CC--dd commonly is, see
              above for the effects.  This may also be bound to the Delete key
              on some keyboards.

              Delete  the  character  behind the cursor.  When given a numeric
              argument, save the deleted text on the kill ring.
       ffoorrwwaarrdd--bbaacckkwwaarrdd--ddeelleettee--cchhaarr
              Delete the character under the cursor, unless the cursor  is  at
              the end of the line, in which case the character behind the cur-
              sor is deleted.
       qquuootteedd--iinnsseerrtt ((CC--qq,, CC--vv))
              Add  the next character typed to the line verbatim.  This is how
              to insert characters like CC--qq, for example.
       ttaabb--iinnsseerrtt ((MM--TTAABB))
              Insert a tab character.

              Insert the character typed.
       bbrraacckkeetteedd--ppaassttee--bbeeggiinn
              This function is intended to be bound to the  "bracketed  paste"
              escape  sequence  sent  by some terminals, and such a binding is
              assigned by default.  It allows rreeaaddlliinnee to  insert  the  pasted
              text  as  a single unit without treating each character as if it
              had been read from the keyboard.  The pasted characters are  in-
              serted  as  if each one was bound to sseellff--iinnsseerrtt instead of exe-
              cuting any editing commands.
              Bracketed paste sets the region to the inserted text  and  acti-
              vates the region.
       ttrraannssppoossee--cchhaarrss ((CC--tt))
              Drag  the  character  before point forward over the character at
              point, moving point forward as well.  If point is at the end  of
              the  line, then this transposes the two characters before point.
              Negative arguments have no effect.
       ttrraannssppoossee--wwoorrddss ((MM--tt))
              Drag the word before point past the  word  after  point,  moving
              point  past  that  word  as well.  If point is at the end of the
              line, this transposes the last two words on the line.
       uuppccaassee--wwoorrdd ((MM--uu))
              Uppercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative  ar-
              gument, uppercase the previous word, but do not move point.
       ddoowwnnccaassee--wwoorrdd ((MM--ll))
              Lowercase  the current (or following) word.  With a negative ar-
              gument, lowercase the previous word, but do not move point.
       ccaappiittaalliizzee--wwoorrdd ((MM--cc))
              Capitalize the current (or following) word.  With a negative ar-
              gument, capitalize the previous word, but do not move point.
       oovveerrwwrriittee--mmooddee
              Toggle overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive numeric  argu-
              ment, switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit non-positive
              numeric argument, switches to insert mode.  This command affects
              only  eemmaaccss mode; vvii mode does overwrite differently.  Each call
              to _r_e_a_d_l_i_n_e_(_) starts in insert mode.
              In overwrite mode, characters bound to sseellff--iinnsseerrtt  replace  the
              text  at point rather than pushing the text to the right.  Char-
              acters bound to bbaacckkwwaarrdd--ddeelleettee--cchhaarr replace the  character  be-
              fore  point  with a space.  By default, this command is unbound,
              but may be bound to the Insert key on some keyboards.

              Kill the text from point to the end of the current line.  With a
              negative numeric argument, kill backward from the cursor to  the
              beginning of the line.

              is.
       kkiillll--wwoorrdd ((MM--dd))
              Kill from point to the end of the current word,  or  if  between
              words,  to  the  end  of the next word.  Word boundaries are the
              same as those used by ffoorrwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd.

              Kill the word behind point.  Word boundaries  are  the  same  as
              those used by bbaacckkwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd.
       uunniixx--wwoorrdd--rruubboouutt ((CC--ww))
              Kill  the  word behind point, using white space as a word bound-
              ary, saving the killed text on the kill-ring.
       uunniixx--ffiilleennaammee--rruubboouutt
              Kill the word behind point, using  white  space  and  the  slash
              character  as the word boundaries, saving the killed text on the
              kill-ring.

       kkiillll--rreeggiioonn
              Kill the text in the current region.
       ccooppyy--rreeggiioonn--aass--kkiillll
              Copy the text in the region to the kill buffer,  so  it  can  be
              yanked immediately.
       ccooppyy--bbaacckkwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd
              Copy  the word before point to the kill buffer.  The word bound-
              aries are the same as bbaacckkwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd.
       ccooppyy--ffoorrwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd
              Copy the word following point to  the  kill  buffer.   The  word
              boundaries are the same as ffoorrwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd.
       yyaannkk ((CC--yy))
              Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.
       yyaannkk--ppoopp ((MM--yy))
              Rotate  the kill ring, and yank the new top.  Only works follow-
              ing yyaannkk or yyaannkk--ppoopp.

   NNuummeerriicc AArrgguummeennttss

              Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start  a
              new argument.  M-- starts a negative argument.
       uunniivveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt
              This  is another way to specify an argument.  If this command is
              followed by one or more digits, optionally with a leading  minus
              sign,  those digits define the argument.  If the command is fol-
              lowed by digits, executing uunniivveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt again ends the nu-
              meric argument, but is otherwise ignored.  As a special case, if
              this command is immediately followed by a character that is nei-
              ther a digit nor minus sign, the argument  count  for  the  next
              command  is multiplied by four.  The argument count is initially
              one, so executing this function the first time makes  the  argu-
              ment count four, a second time makes the argument count sixteen,
              and so on.

   CCoommpplleettiinngg
       ccoommpplleettee ((TTAABB))
              Attempt to perform completion on the text before point.  The ac-
              tual  completion  performed  is application-specific.  BBaasshh, for
              instance,  attempts  programmable  completion  first,  otherwise
              treating  the  text  as  a variable (if the text begins with $$),
              username (if the text begins with ~~), hostname (if the text  be-
              gins  with  @@),  or  command  (including aliases, functions, and
              builtins) in turn.  If none of these produces a match, it  falls
              back  to  filename  completion.   GGddbb, on the other hand, allows
              completion of program functions and variables, and only attempts
              filename completion under certain  circumstances.   The  default
              rreeaaddlliinnee completion is filename completion.
       ppoossssiibbllee--ccoommpplleettiioonnss ((MM--??))
              List  the  possible  completions of the text before point.  When
              displaying completions, rreeaaddlliinnee sets the number of columns used
              for display to the value of ccoommpplleettiioonn--ddiissppllaayy--wwiiddtthh, the  value
              of  the  environment  variable  CCOOLLUUMMNNSS, or the screen width, in
              that order.
       iinnsseerrtt--ccoommpplleettiioonnss ((MM--**))
              Insert all completions of the text before point that would  have
              been generated by ppoossssiibbllee--ccoommpplleettiioonnss, separated by a space.
       mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee
              Similar  to ccoommpplleettee, but replaces the word to be completed with
              a single match from the list of possible  completions.   Repeat-
              edly  executing mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee steps through the list of possible
              completions, inserting each match in turn.  At the  end  of  the
              list  of  completions,  mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee rings the bell (subject to
              the setting of bbeellll--ssttyyllee) and restores the original  text.   An
              argument  of _n moves _n positions forward in the list of matches;
              a negative argument moves backward through the list.  This  com-
              mand is intended to be bound to TTAABB, but is unbound by default.
       mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee--bbaacckkwwaarrdd
              Identical  to mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee, but moves backward through the list
              of possible completions, as if mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee had  been  given  a
              negative argument.  This command is unbound by default.
       eexxppoorrtt--ccoommpplleettiioonnss
              Perform  completion  on the word before point as described above
              and write the list of possible completions to rreeaaddlliinnee's  output
              stream  using the following format, writing information on sepa-
              rate lines:

              +o      the number of matches _N;
              +o      the word being completed;
              +o      _S:_E, where _S and _E are the start and end offsets  of  the
                     word in the rreeaaddlliinnee line buffer; then
              +o      each match, one per line

              If  there  are  no matches, the first line will be "0", and this
              command does not print any output after the _S:_E.   If  there  is
              only  a  single  match, this prints a single line containing it.
              If there is more than one match, this prints the  common  prefix
              of  the matches, which may be empty, on the first line after the
              _S:_E, then the matches on subsequent lines.  In this case, _N will
              include the first line with the common prefix.

              The user or application should be able to accommodate the possi-
              bility of a blank line.  The intent is that the user or applica-
              tion reads _N lines after the line containing _S:_E to  obtain  the
              match list.  This command is unbound by default.

       ddeelleettee--cchhaarr--oorr--lliisstt
              Deletes  the  character under the cursor if not at the beginning
              or end of the line (like ddeelleettee--cchhaarr).  At the end of the  line,
              it behaves identically to ppoossssiibbllee--ccoommpplleettiioonnss.  This command is
              unbound by default.

              Re-execute the last keyboard macro defined, by making the  char-
              acters in the macro appear as if typed at the keyboard.
       pprriinntt--llaasstt--kkbbdd--mmaaccrroo (())
              Print  the  last keyboard macro defined in a format suitable for

              Read in the contents of the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file,  and  incorporate  any
              bindings or variable assignments found there.

              Abort  the  current editing command and ring the terminal's bell
              (subject to the setting of bbeellll--ssttyyllee).

              If the metafied character _x is uppercase, run the  command  that
              is bound to the corresponding metafied lowercase character.  The
              behavior is undefined if _x is already lowercase.
       pprreeffiixx--mmeettaa ((EESSCC))
              Metafy the next character typed.  EESSCC ff is equivalent to MMeettaa--ff.
       uunnddoo ((CC--__,, CC--xx CC--uu))

       sseett--mmaarrkk ((CC--@@,, MM--<<ssppaaccee>>))

              set the mark to that position.

              Swap the point with the mark.  Set the current  cursor  position
              to the saved position, then set the mark to the old cursor posi-
              tion.
       cchhaarraacctteerr--sseeaarrcchh ((CC--]]))
              Read  a  character and move point to the next occurrence of that
              character.  A negative argument  searches  for  previous  occur-
              rences.

              Read  a  character  and move point to the previous occurrence of
              that character.  A negative argument searches for subsequent oc-
              currences.
       sskkiipp--ccssii--sseeqquueennccee
              Read enough characters to consume a multi-key sequence  such  as
              those  defined  for keys like Home and End.  CSI sequences begin
              with a Control Sequence Indicator (CSI), usually _E_S_C _[.  If this
              sequence is bound to "\e[", keys producing CSI sequences have no
              effect unless explicitly bound to a rreeaaddlliinnee command, instead of
              inserting stray characters into the editing buffer.  This is un-
              bound by default, but usually bound to _E_S_C _[.
       iinnsseerrtt--ccoommmmeenntt ((MM--##))
              Without a numeric argument, insert the  value  of  the  rreeaaddlliinnee
              ccoommmmeenntt--bbeeggiinn variable at the beginning of the current line.  If
              a  numeric  argument is supplied, this command acts as a toggle:
              if the characters at the beginning of the line do not match  the
              value  of  ccoommmmeenntt--bbeeggiinn, insert the value; otherwise delete the
              characters in ccoommmmeenntt--bbeeggiinn from the beginning of the line.   In
              either  case,  the  line  is  accepted  as if a newline had been
              typed.  The default value of ccoommmmeenntt--bbeeggiinn causes  this  command
              to make the current line a shell comment.  If a numeric argument
              causes the comment character to be removed, the line will be ex-
              ecuted by the shell.
       dduummpp--ffuunnccttiioonnss

              lliinnee output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the out-
              put is formatted in such a way that it can be made  part  of  an
              _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file.
       dduummpp--vvaarriiaabblleess

              rreeaaddlliinnee output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied,  the
              output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an
              _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file.
       dduummpp--mmaaccrrooss
              Print  all of the rreeaaddlliinnee key sequences bound to macros and the
              strings they output to the rreeaaddlliinnee output stream.  If a numeric
              argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that
              it can be made part of an _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file.

              Read a bindable rreeaaddlliinnee command name from the input and execute
              the function to which it's bound, as  if  the  key  sequence  to
              which  it  was bound appeared in the input.  If this function is
              supplied with a numeric argument, it passes that argument to the
              function it executes.

       The following is a list of the default emacs and vi bindings.   Charac-
       ters  with the eighth bit set are written as M-<character>, and are re-
       ferred to as _m_e_t_a_f_i_e_d characters.  The printable ASCII  characters  not
       mentioned  in  the  list  of  emacs  standard bindings are bound to the
       sseellff--iinnsseerrtt function, which just inserts the given character  into  the
       input line.  In vi insertion mode, all characters not specifically men-
       tioned are bound to sseellff--iinnsseerrtt.  Characters assigned to signal genera-
       tion by _s_t_t_y(1) or the terminal driver, such as C-Z or C-C, retain that
       function.   Upper  and  lower case metafied characters are bound to the
       same function in the emacs mode meta keymap.  The remaining  characters
       are  unbound,  which  causes  rreeaaddlliinnee to ring the bell (subject to the
       setting of the bbeellll--ssttyyllee variable).
