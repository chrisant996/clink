[1mNAME[0m
       history - GNU History Library

[1mCOPYRIGHT[0m
       The GNU History Library is Copyright (C) 1989-2020 by the Free Software
       Foundation, Inc.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Many programs read input from the user a line at a time.  The GNU  His-
       tory  library is able to keep track of those lines, associate arbitrary
       data with each line, and utilize information  from  previous  lines  in
       composing new ones.

[1mHISTORY EXPANSION[0m
       The  history library supports a history expansion feature that is iden-
       tical to the history expansion in [1mbash.  [22mThis  section  describes  what
       syntax features are available.

       History expansions introduce words from the history list into the input
       stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the  arguments  to  a
       previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous
       commands quickly.

       History expansion is usually performed  immediately  after  a  complete
       line  is read.  It takes place in two parts.  The first is to determine
       which line from the history list to use during substitution.  The  sec-
       ond  is  to select portions of that line for inclusion into the current
       one.  The line selected from the history is the [4mevent[24m, and the portions
       of  that  line  that  are  acted upon are [4mwords[24m.  Various [4mmodifiers[24m are
       available to manipulate the selected words.  The line  is  broken  into
       words in the same fashion as [1mbash [22mdoes when reading input, so that sev-
       eral words that would otherwise be separated are  considered  one  word
       when  surrounded  by  quotes (see the description of [1mhistory_tokenize()[0m
       below).  History expansions are introduced by  the  appearance  of  the
       history expansion character, which is [1m! [22mby default.  Only backslash ([1m\[22m)
       and single quotes can quote the history expansion character.

   [1mEvent Designators[0m
       An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the  his-
       tory  list.   Unless  the reference is absolute, events are relative to
       the current position in the history list.

       [1m!      [22mStart a history substitution, except when followed by  a  [1mblank[22m,
              newline, = or (.
       [1m![4m[22mn[24m     Refer to command line [4mn[24m.
       [1m!-[4m[22mn[24m    Refer to the current command minus [4mn[24m.
       [1m!!     [22mRefer to the previous command.  This is a synonym for `!-1'.
       [1m![4m[22mstring[0m
              Refer  to the most recent command preceding the current position
              in the history list starting with [4mstring[24m.
       [1m!?[4m[22mstring[24m[1m[?][0m
              Refer to the most recent command preceding the current  position
              in  the  history  list containing [4mstring[24m.  The trailing [1m? [22mmay be
              omitted if [4mstring[24m is followed  immediately  by  a  newline.   If
              [4mstring[24m  is  missing,  the  string from the most recent search is
              used; it is an error if there is no previous search string.
       [1m^[4m[22mstring1[24m[1m^[4m[22mstring2[24m[1m^[0m
              Quick substitution.  Repeat the last command, replacing  [4mstring1[0m
              with [4mstring2[24m.  Equivalent to ``!!:s^[4mstring1[24m^[4mstring2[24m^'' (see [1mMod-[0m
              [1mifiers [22mbelow).
       [1m!#     [22mThe entire command line typed so far.

   [1mWord Designators[0m
       Word designators are used to select desired words from the event.  A  [1m:[0m
       separates  the event specification from the word designator.  It may be
       omitted if the word designator begins with a [1m^[22m, [1m$[22m, [1m*[22m, [1m-[22m, or  [1m%[22m.   Words
       are  numbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word being
       denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are inserted into the  current  line  sepa-
       rated by single spaces.

       [1m0 (zero)[0m
              The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.
       [4mn[24m      The [4mn[24mth word.
       [1m^      [22mThe first argument.  That is, word 1.
       [1m$      [22mThe  last word.  This is usually the last argument, but will ex-
              pand to the zeroth word if there is only one word in the line.
       [1m%      [22mThe first word matched by the most recent `?[4mstring[24m?' search,  if
              the  search  string  begins  with  a character that is part of a
              word.
       [4mx[24m[1m-[4m[22my[24m    A range of words; `-[4my[24m' abbreviates `0-[4my[24m'.
       [1m*      [22mAll of the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym  for  `[4m1-$[24m'.
              It  is  not  an  error to use [1m* [22mif there is just one word in the
              event; the empty string is returned in that case.
       [1mx*     [22mAbbreviates [4mx-$[24m.
       [1mx-     [22mAbbreviates [4mx-$[24m like [1mx*[22m, but omits the last word.  If [1mx [22mis miss-
              ing, it defaults to 0.

       If  a  word  designator is supplied without an event specification, the
       previous command is used as the event.

   [1mModifiers[0m
       After the optional word designator, there may appear a sequence of  one
       or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a `:'.  These mod-
       ify, or edit, the word or words selected from the history event.

       [1mh      [22mRemove a trailing file name component, leaving only the head.
       [1mt      [22mRemove all leading file name components, leaving the tail.
       [1mr      [22mRemove a trailing suffix of the form [4m.xxx[24m, leaving the basename.
       [1me      [22mRemove all but the trailing suffix.
       [1mp      [22mPrint the new command but do not execute it.
       [1mq      [22mQuote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.
       [1mx      [22mQuote the substituted words as with [1mq[22m, but break into  words  at
              [1mblanks  [22mand newlines.  The [1mq [22mand [1mx [22mmodifiers are mutually exclu-
              sive; the last one supplied is used.
       [1ms/[4m[22mold[24m[1m/[4m[22mnew[24m[1m/[0m
              Substitute [4mnew[24m for the first occurrence  of  [4mold[24m  in  the  event
              line.  Any character may be used as the delimiter in place of /.
              The final delimiter is optional if it is the last  character  of
              the event line.  The delimiter may be quoted in [4mold[24m and [4mnew[24m with
              a single backslash.  If & appears in [4mnew[24m, it is replaced by [4mold[24m.
              A  single backslash will quote the &.  If [4mold[24m is null, it is set
              to the last [4mold[24m substituted, or, if no previous history  substi-
              tutions  took  place,  the last [4mstring[24m in a [1m!?[4m[22mstring[24m[1m[?]  [22msearch.
              If [4mnew[24m is null, each matching [4mold[24m is deleted.
       [1m&      [22mRepeat the previous substitution.
       [1mg      [22mCause changes to be applied over the entire event line.  This is
              used  in  conjunction  with `[1m:s[22m' (e.g., `[1m:gs/[4m[22mold[24m[1m/[4m[22mnew[24m[1m/[22m') or `[1m:&[22m'.
              If used with `[1m:s[22m', any delimiter can be used in place of /,  and
              the  final  delimiter is optional if it is the last character of
              the event line.  An [1ma [22mmay be used as a synonym for [1mg[22m.
       [1mG      [22mApply the following `[1ms[22m' or `[1m&[22m' modifier once to each word in the
              event line.

[1mPROGRAMMING WITH HISTORY FUNCTIONS[0m
       This  section  describes  how  to use the History library in other pro-
       grams.

   [1mIntroduction to History[0m
       A programmer using the History library has available functions for  re-
       membering  lines  on  a history list, associating arbitrary data with a
       line, removing lines from the list, searching through the  list  for  a
       line  containing  an arbitrary text string, and referencing any line in
       the list directly.  In addition, a history [4mexpansion[24m function is avail-
       able  which  provides  for a consistent user interface across different
       programs.

       The user using programs written with the History library has the  bene-
       fit  of  a  consistent user interface with a set of well-known commands
       for manipulating the text of previous lines and using that text in  new
       commands.  The basic history manipulation commands are identical to the
       history substitution provided by [1mbash[22m.

       The programmer can also use the Readline library, which  includes  some
       history manipulation by default, and has the added advantage of command
       line editing.

       Before declaring any functions using any functionality the History  li-
       brary  provides in other code, an application writer should include the
       file [4m<readline/history.h>[24m in any file that uses the  History  library's
       features.   It  supplies  extern  declarations for all of the library's
       public functions and variables, and declares all  of  the  public  data
       structures.

   [1mHistory Storage[0m
       The  history  list  is an array of history entries.  A history entry is
       declared as follows:

       [4mtypedef[24m [4mvoid[24m [4m*[24m [1mhistdata_t;[0m

       typedef struct _hist_entry {
         char *line;
         char *timestamp;
         histdata_t data;
       } HIST_ENTRY;

       The history list itself might therefore be declared as

       [4mHIST_ENTRY[24m [4m**[24m [1mthe_history_list;[0m

       The state of the History library is encapsulated into a  single  struc-
       ture:

       /*
        * A structure used to pass around the current state of the history.
        */
       typedef struct _hist_state {
         HIST_ENTRY **entries; /* Pointer to the entries themselves. */
         int offset;           /* The location pointer within this array. */
         int length;           /* Number of elements within this array. */
         int size;             /* Number of slots allocated to this array. */
         int flags;
       } HISTORY_STATE;

       If the flags member includes [1mHS_STIFLED[22m, the history has been stifled.

[1mHistory Functions[0m
       This  section  describes the calling sequence for the various functions
       exported by the GNU History library.

   [1mInitializing History and State Management[0m
       This section describes functions used  to  initialize  and  manage  the
       state of the History library when you want to use the history functions
       in your program.

       [4mvoid[24m [1musing_history [22m([4mvoid[24m)
       Begin a session in which the history functions  might  be  used.   This
       initializes the interactive variables.

       [4mHISTORY_STATE[24m [4m*[24m [1mhistory_get_history_state [22m([4mvoid[24m)
       Return a structure describing the current state of the input history.

       [4mvoid[24m [1mhistory_set_history_state [22m([4mHISTORY_STATE[24m [4m*state[24m)
       Set the state of the history list according to [4mstate[24m.


   [1mHistory List Management[0m
       These  functions  manage individual entries on the history list, or set
       parameters managing the list itself.

       [4mvoid[24m [1madd_history [22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*string[24m)
       Place [4mstring[24m at the end of the history list.  The associated data field
       (if  any) is set to [1mNULL[22m.  If the maximum number of history entries has
       been set using [1mstifle_history()[22m, and the new number of history  entries
       would exceed that maximum, the oldest history entry is removed.

       [4mvoid[24m [1madd_history_time [22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*string[24m)
       Change  the time stamp associated with the most recent history entry to
       [4mstring[24m.

       [4mHIST_ENTRY[24m [4m*[24m [1mremove_history [22m([4mint[24m [4mwhich[24m)
       Remove history entry at offset [4mwhich[24m from the history.  The removed el-
       ement is returned so you can free the line, data, and containing struc-
       ture.

       [4mhistdata_t[24m [1mfree_history_entry [22m([4mHIST_ENTRY[24m [4m*histent[24m)
       Free the history entry [4mhistent[24m and any history library private data as-
       sociated  with it.  Returns the application-specific data so the caller
       can dispose of it.

       [4mHIST_ENTRY[24m [4m*[24m [1mreplace_history_entry [22m([4mint[24m [4mwhich,[24m [4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*line,[24m  [4mhist-[0m
       [4mdata_t[24m [4mdata[24m)
       Make  the  history  entry at offset [4mwhich[24m have [4mline[24m and [4mdata[24m.  This re-
       turns the old entry so the caller can dispose of  any  application-spe-
       cific  data.   In  the  case of an invalid [4mwhich[24m, a [1mNULL [22mpointer is re-
       turned.

       [4mvoid[24m [1mclear_history [22m([4mvoid[24m)
       Clear the history list by deleting all the entries.

       [4mvoid[24m [1mstifle_history [22m([4mint[24m [4mmax[24m)
       Stifle the history list, remembering only the last  [4mmax[24m  entries.   The
       history list will contain only [4mmax[24m entries at a time.

       [4mint[24m [1munstifle_history [22m([4mvoid[24m)
       Stop  stifling  the  history.   This returns the previously-set maximum
       number of history entries (as set by  [1mstifle_history()[22m).   history  was
       stifled.  The value is positive if the history was stifled, negative if
       it wasn't.

       [4mint[24m [1mhistory_is_stifled [22m([4mvoid[24m)
       Returns non-zero if the history is stifled, zero if it is not.


   [1mInformation About the History List[0m
       These functions return information about the entire history list or in-
       dividual list entries.

       [4mHIST_ENTRY[24m [4m**[24m [1mhistory_list [22m([4mvoid[24m)
       Return a [1mNULL [22mterminated array of [4mHIST_ENTRY[24m [4m*[24m which is the current in-
       put history.  Element 0 of this list is  the  beginning  of  time.   If
       there is no history, return [1mNULL[22m.

       [4mint[24m [1mwhere_history [22m([4mvoid[24m)
       Returns the offset of the current history element.

       [4mHIST_ENTRY[24m [4m*[24m [1mcurrent_history [22m([4mvoid[24m)
       Return  the  history  entry  at  the current position, as determined by
       [1mwhere_history()[22m.  If there is no entry there, return a [1mNULL [22mpointer.

       [4mHIST_ENTRY[24m [4m*[24m [1mhistory_get [22m([4mint[24m [4moffset[24m)
       Return the history entry at position [4moffset[24m.  The range of valid values
       of  [4moffset[24m  starts  at [1mhistory_base [22mand ends at [1mhistory_length [22m- 1.  If
       there is no entry there, or if [4moffset[24m is outside the valid  range,  re-
       turn a [1mNULL [22mpointer.

       [4mtime_t[24m [1mhistory_get_time [22m([4mHIST_ENTRY[24m [4m*[24m)
       Return  the  time stamp associated with the history entry passed as the
       argument.

       [4mint[24m [1mhistory_total_bytes [22m([4mvoid[24m)
       Return the number of bytes that the primary history entries are  using.
       This  function  returns  the sum of the lengths of all the lines in the
       history.


   [1mMoving Around the History List[0m
       These functions allow the current index into the history list to be set
       or changed.

       [4mint[24m [1mhistory_set_pos [22m([4mint[24m [4mpos[24m)
       Set the current history offset to [4mpos[24m, an absolute index into the list.
       Returns 1 on success, 0 if [4mpos[24m is less than zero or  greater  than  the
       number of history entries.

       [4mHIST_ENTRY[24m [4m*[24m [1mprevious_history [22m([4mvoid[24m)
       Back  up  the current history offset to the previous history entry, and
       return a pointer to that entry.  If there is no previous entry,  return
       a [1mNULL [22mpointer.

       [4mHIST_ENTRY[24m [4m*[24m [1mnext_history [22m([4mvoid[24m)
       If  the  current history offset refers to a valid history entry, incre-
       ment the current history offset.  If the  possibly-incremented  history
       offset refers to a valid history entry, return a pointer to that entry;
       otherwise, return a [1mNULL [22mpointer.


   [1mSearching the History List[0m
       These functions allow searching of the history list  for  entries  con-
       taining a specific string.  Searching may be performed both forward and
       backward from the current history position.   The  search  may  be  [4man-[0m
       [4mchored[24m, meaning that the string must match at the beginning of the his-
       tory entry.

       [4mint[24m [1mhistory_search [22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*string,[24m [4mint[24m [4mdirection[24m)
       Search the history for [4mstring[24m, starting at the current history  offset.
       If  [4mdirection[24m  is  less than 0, then the search is through previous en-
       tries, otherwise through subsequent entries.  If [4mstring[24m is found,  then
       the  current  history index is set to that history entry, and the value
       returned is the offset in the line of the entry where [4mstring[24m was found.
       Otherwise, nothing is changed, and a -1 is returned.

       [4mint[24m [1mhistory_search_prefix [22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*string,[24m [4mint[24m [4mdirection[24m)
       Search  the history for [4mstring[24m, starting at the current history offset.
       The search is anchored: matching lines must begin with [4mstring[24m.  If  [4mdi-[0m
       [4mrection[24m  is  less  than 0, then the search is through previous entries,
       otherwise through subsequent entries.  If [4mstring[24m  is  found,  then  the
       current  history index is set to that entry, and the return value is 0.
       Otherwise, nothing is changed, and a -1 is returned.

       Search for [4mstring[24m in the history list, starting at [4mpos[24m, an absolute in-
       dex into the list.  If [4mdirection[24m is negative, the search proceeds back-
       ward from [4mpos[24m, otherwise forward.  Returns the absolute  index  of  the
       history element where [4mstring[24m was found, or -1 otherwise.


   [1mManaging the History File[0m
       The  History  library can read the history from and write it to a file.
       This section documents the functions for managing a history file.

       [4mint[24m [1mread_history [22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*filename[24m)
       Add the contents of [4mfilename[24m to the history list, a line at a time.  If
       [4mfilename[24m  is [1mNULL[22m, then read from [4m~/.history[24m.  Returns 0 if successful,
       or [1merrno [22mif not.

       [4mint[24m [1mread_history_range [22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*filename,[24m [4mint[24m [4mfrom,[24m [4mint[24m [4mto[24m)
       Read a range of lines from [4mfilename[24m, adding them to the  history  list.
       Start  reading  at  line [4mfrom[24m and end at [4mto[24m.  If [4mfrom[24m is zero, start at
       the beginning.  If [4mto[24m is less than [4mfrom[24m, then read until the end of the
       file.   If  [4mfilename[24m  is [1mNULL[22m, then read from [4m~/.history[24m.  Returns 0 if
       successful, or [1merrno [22mif not.

       [4mint[24m [1mwrite_history [22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*filename[24m)
       Write the current history to [4mfilename[24m, overwriting [4mfilename[24m  if  neces-
       sary.   If [4mfilename[24m is [1mNULL[22m, then write the history list to [4m~/.history[24m.
       Returns 0 on success, or [1merrno [22mon a read or write error.


       [4mint[24m [1mappend_history [22m([4mint[24m [4mnelements,[24m [4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*filename[24m)
       Append the last [4mnelements[24m of the history list to [4mfilename[24m.  If [4mfilename[0m
       is  [1mNULL[22m, then append to [4m~/.history[24m.  Returns 0 on success, or [1merrno [22mon
       a read or write error.

       [4mint[24m [1mhistory_truncate_file [22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*filename,[24m [4mint[24m [4mnlines[24m)
       Truncate the history file [4mfilename[24m, leaving only the last [4mnlines[24m lines.
       If  [4mfilename[24m  is [1mNULL[22m, then [4m~/.history[24m is truncated.  Returns 0 on suc-
       cess, or [1merrno [22mon failure.


   [1mHistory Expansion[0m
       These functions implement history expansion.

       [4mint[24m [1mhistory_expand [22m([4mchar[24m [4m*string,[24m [4mchar[24m [4m**output[24m)
       Expand [4mstring[24m, placing the result into [4moutput[24m, a pointer to  a  string.
       Returns:
              0      If  no  expansions  took place (or, if the only change in
                     the text was the removal of escape  characters  preceding
                     the history expansion character);
              1      if expansions did take place;
              -1     if there was an error in expansion;
              2      if  the  returned  line should be displayed, but not exe-
                     cuted, as with the [1m:p [22mmodifier.
       If an error occurred in expansion, then [4moutput[24m contains  a  descriptive
       error message.

       [4mchar[24m [4m*[24m [1mget_history_event [22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*string,[24m [4mint[24m [4m*cindex,[24m [4mint[24m [4mqchar[24m)
       Returns  the  text  of the history event beginning at [4mstring[24m + [4m*cindex[24m.
       [4m*cindex[24m is modified to point to after the event specifier.  At function
       entry,  [4mcindex[24m  points to the index into [4mstring[24m where the history event
       specification begins.  [4mqchar[24m is a character that is allowed to end  the
       event  specification  in addition to the ``normal'' terminating charac-
       ters.

       [4mchar[24m [4m**[24m [1mhistory_tokenize [22m([4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*string[24m)
       Return an array of tokens parsed out  of  [4mstring[24m,  much  as  the  shell
       might.   The tokens are split on the characters in the [1mhistory_word_de-[0m
       [1mlimiters [22mvariable, and shell quoting conventions are obeyed.

       [4mchar[24m [4m*[24m [1mhistory_arg_extract [22m([4mint[24m [4mfirst,[24m [4mint[24m [4mlast,[24m [4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*string[24m)
       Extract a string segment consisting of the [4mfirst[24m through [4mlast[24m arguments
       present in [4mstring[24m.  Arguments are split using [1mhistory_tokenize()[22m.


   [1mHistory Variables[0m
       This section describes the externally-visible variables exported by the
       GNU History Library.

       [4mint[24m [1mhistory_base[0m
       The logical offset of the first entry in the history list.

       [4mint[24m [1mhistory_length[0m
       The number of entries currently stored in the history list.

       [4mint[24m [1mhistory_max_entries[0m
       The maximum number of history entries.  This must be changed using [1msti-[0m
       [1mfle_history()[22m.

       [4mint[24m [1mhistory_write_timestamps[0m
       If non-zero, timestamps are written to the history file, so they can be
       preserved between sessions.  The default value is 0, meaning that time-
       stamps  are  not saved.  The current timestamp format uses the value of
       [4mhistory_comment_char[24m to delimit timestamp entries in the history  file.
       If  that  variable does not have a value (the default), timestamps will
       not be written.

       [4mchar[24m [1mhistory_expansion_char[0m
       The character that introduces a history event.  The default is [1m![22m.  Set-
       ting this to 0 inhibits history expansion.

       [4mchar[24m [1mhistory_subst_char[0m
       The character that invokes word substitution if found at the start of a
       line.  The default is [1m^[22m.

       [4mchar[24m [1mhistory_comment_char[0m
       During tokenization, if this character is seen as the  first  character
       of  a  word,  then it and all subsequent characters up to a newline are
       ignored, suppressing history expansion for the remainder of  the  line.
       This is disabled by default.

       [4mchar[24m [4m*[24m [1mhistory_word_delimiters[0m
       The  characters  that  separate tokens for [1mhistory_tokenize()[22m.  The de-
       fault value is [1m" \t\n()<>;&|"[22m.

       [4mchar[24m [4m*[24m [1mhistory_no_expand_chars[0m
       The list of characters which inhibit history expansion if found immedi-
       ately  following  [1mhistory_expansion_char[22m.   The  default is space, tab,
       newline, [1m\r[22m, and [1m=[22m.

       [4mchar[24m [4m*[24m [1mhistory_search_delimiter_chars[0m
       The list of additional characters which can delimit  a  history  search
       string,  in  addition to space, tab, [4m:[24m and [4m?[24m in the case of a substring
       search.  The default is empty.

       [4mint[24m [1mhistory_quotes_inhibit_expansion[0m
       If non-zero, double-quoted words are not scanned for the history expan-
       sion  character or the history comment character.  The default value is
       0.

       [4mrl_linebuf_func_t[24m [4m*[24m [1mhistory_inhibit_expansion_function[0m
       This should be set to the address of a function that  takes  two  argu-
       ments:  a  [1mchar  *  [22m([4mstring[24m) and an [1mint [22mindex into that string ([4mi[24m).  It
       should return a non-zero value if the  history  expansion  starting  at
       [4mstring[i][24m  should  not  be  performed;  zero if the expansion should be
       done.  It is intended for use by applications like [1mbash  [22mthat  use  the
       history  expansion character for additional purposes.  By default, this
       variable is set to [1mNULL[22m.

[1mFILES[0m
       [4m~/.history[0m
              Default filename for reading and writing saved history
