       Many  programs read input from the user a line at a time.  The GNU His-
       tory library is able to keep track of those lines, associate  arbitrary
       data  with  each line, and utilize information from previous lines when
       composing new ones.

       The History library provides functions that allow applications to their
       _h_i_s_t_o_r_y, the set of previously-typed lines, which it keeps in  a  list.
       Applications  can  choose  which lines to save into a history list, how
       many commands to save, save a history list to a file,  read  a  history
       list  from  a  file, and display lines from the history in various for-
       mats.

HHIISSTTOORRYY EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN
       The history library supports a history expansion feature that is  iden-
       tical  to  the  history expansion in bbaasshh.  This section describes what
       syntax features are available.

       History expansions introduce words from the history list into the input
       stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the  arguments  to  a
       previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous
       commands quickly.

       History  expansion  is  usually  performed immediately after a complete
       line is read.  It takes place in two parts.  The first is to  determine
       which  history list entry to use during substitution.  The second is to
       select portions of that entry to include into the current one.

       The entry selected from the history is the _e_v_e_n_t, and the  portions  of
       that entry that are acted upon are _w_o_r_d_s.  Various _m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r_s are avail-
       able  to  manipulate the selected words.  The entry is split into words
       in the same fashion as bbaasshh does when reading input,  so  that  several
       words  that  would  otherwise be separated are considered one word when
       surrounded by quotes (see the description of hhiissttoorryy__ttookkeenniizzee(()) below).
       The _e_v_e_n_t _d_e_s_i_g_n_a_t_o_r selects the event, the  optional  _w_o_r_d  _d_e_s_i_g_n_a_t_o_r
       selects words from the event, and various optional _m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r_s are avail-
       able to manipulate the selected words.

       History  expansions are introduced by the appearance of the history ex-
       pansion character, which is !! by default.  History expansions  may  ap-
       pear anywhere in the input, but do not nest.

       Only  backslash  (\\)  and single quotes can quote the history expansion
       character.

       There is a special abbreviation for substitution, active when the _q_u_i_c_k
       _s_u_b_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n character (default ^^) is the first character on the  line.
       It  selects  the previous history list entry, using an event designator
       equivalent to !!!!, and substitutes one string for another in that entry.
       It is described below under EEvveenntt DDeessiiggnnaattoorrss.  This is the  only  his-
       tory  expansion  that does not begin with the history expansion charac-
       ter.

   EEvveenntt DDeessiiggnnaattoorrss
       An event designator is a reference to an entry  in  the  history  list.
       The event designator consists of the portion of the word beginning with
       the  history expansion character and ending with the word designator if
       present, or the end of the word.  Unless  the  reference  is  absolute,
       events are relative to the current position in the history list.

       !!      Start  a  history substitution, except when followed by a bbllaannkk,
              newline, carriage return, =, or (.
       !!_n     Refer to history list entry _n.
       !!--_n    Refer to the current entry minus _n.
       !!!!     Refer to the previous entry.  This is a synonym for "!-1".
       !!_s_t_r_i_n_g
              Refer to the most recent command preceding the current  position
              in the history list starting with _s_t_r_i_n_g.
       !!??_s_t_r_i_n_g[[??]]
              Refer  to the most recent command preceding the current position
              in the history list containing _s_t_r_i_n_g.  The trailing  ??  may  be
              omitted  if  _s_t_r_i_n_g  is  followed  immediately by a newline.  If
              _s_t_r_i_n_g is missing, this uses the string  from  the  most  recent
              search; it is an error if there is no previous search string.
       ^^_s_t_r_i_n_g_1^^_s_t_r_i_n_g_2^^
              Quick  substitution.   Repeat  the  previous  command, replacing
              _s_t_r_i_n_g_1 with  _s_t_r_i_n_g_2.   Equivalent  to  "!!:s^_s_t_r_i_n_g_1^_s_t_r_i_n_g_2^"
              (see MMooddiiffiieerrss below).
       !!##     The entire command line typed so far.

       Word designators are used to select desired words from the event.  They
       are optional; if the word designator isn't supplied, the history expan-
       sion uses the entire event.  A :: separates the event specification from
       the  word  designator.  It may be omitted if the word designator begins
       with a ^^, $$, **, --, or %%.  Words are numbered from the beginning of  the
       line,  with  the  first  word being denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are in-
       serted into the current line separated by single spaces.

       00 ((zzeerroo))
              The zeroth word.  For the shell, and  many  other  applications,
              this is the command word.
       _n      The _nth word.
       ^^      The first argument: word 1.
       $$      The  last  word.  This is usually the last argument, but expands
              to the zeroth word if there is only one word in the line.
       %%      The first word matched by the most recent "?_s_t_r_i_n_g?"  search, if
              the search string begins with a character  that  is  part  of  a
              word.   By  default,  searches begin at the end of each line and
              proceed to the beginning, so the first word matched is  the  one
              closest to the end of the line.
       _x--_y    A range of words; "-_y" abbreviates "0-_y".
       **      All  of  the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym for "_1_-_$".
              It is not an error to use ** if there is just  one  word  in  the
              event; it expands to the empty string in that case.
       xx**     Abbreviates _x_-_$.
       xx--     Abbreviates _x_-_$ like xx**, but omits the last word.  If xx is miss-
              ing, it defaults to 0.

       If  a  word  designator is supplied without an event specification, the
       previous command is used as the event, equivalent to !!!!.

   MMooddiiffiieerrss
       After the optional word designator, the expansion  may  include  a  se-
       quence  of  one  or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a
       ":".  These modify, or edit, the word or words selected from  the  his-
       tory event.

       hh      Remove a trailing filename component, leaving only the head.
       tt      Remove all leading filename components, leaving the tail.
       rr      Remove a trailing suffix of the form _._x_x_x, leaving the basename.
       ee      Remove all but the trailing suffix.
       pp      Print the new command but do not execute it.
       qq      Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.
       xx      Quote  the  substituted words as with qq, but break into words at
              bbllaannkkss and newlines.  The qq and xx modifiers are mutually  exclu-
              sive; expansion uses the last one supplied.
       ss//_o_l_d//_n_e_w//
              Substitute  _n_e_w  for  the  first  occurrence of _o_l_d in the event
              line.  Any character may be used as the delimiter in place of /.
              The final delimiter is optional if it is the last  character  of
              the  event line.  A single backslash quotes the delimiter in _o_l_d
              and _n_e_w.  If & appears in _n_e_w, it is replaced with _o_l_d.  A  sin-
              gle  backslash  quotes  the &.  If _o_l_d is null, it is set to the
              last _o_l_d substituted, or, if no previous  history  substitutions
              took place, the last _s_t_r_i_n_g in a !!??_s_t_r_i_n_g[[??]]  search.  If _n_e_w is
              null, each matching _o_l_d is deleted.
       &&      Repeat the previous substitution.
       gg      Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line.  This is
              used  in  conjunction  with "::ss" (e.g., "::ggss//_o_l_d//_n_e_w//") or "::&&".
              If used with "::ss", any delimiter can be used in place of /,  and
              the  final  delimiter is optional if it is the last character of
              the event line.  An aa may be used as a synonym for gg.
       GG      Apply the following "ss" or "&&" modifier once to each word in the
              event line.

       A  programmer using the History library has available functions for re-
       membering lines on a history list, associating arbitrary  data  with  a
       line,  removing  lines  from the list, searching through the list for a
       line containing an arbitrary text string, and referencing any  line  in
       the list directly.  In addition, a history _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n function is avail-
       able  which  provides  for a consistent user interface across different
       programs.

       The user using programs written with the History library has the  bene-
       fit  of  a  consistent user interface with a set of well-known commands
       for manipulating the text of previous lines and using that text in  new
       commands.  The basic history manipulation commands are identical to the
       history substitution provided by bbaasshh.

       The  programmer  can also use the readline library, which includes some
       history manipulation by default, and has the added advantage of command
       line editing.

       Before declaring any functions using any functionality the History  li-
       brary  provides in other code, an application writer should include the
       file _<_r_e_a_d_l_i_n_e_/_h_i_s_t_o_r_y_._h_> in any file that uses the  History  library's
       features.   It  supplies  extern  declarations for all of the library's
       public functions and variables, and declares all  of  the  public  data
       structures.

   HHiissttoorryy SSttoorraaggee
       The  history  list  is an array of history entries.  A history entry is
       declared as follows:

       _t_y_p_e_d_e_f _v_o_i_d _* hhiissttddaattaa__tt;;

       typedef struct _hist_entry {
         char *line;
         char *timestamp;
         histdata_t data;
       } HIST_ENTRY;

       The history list itself might therefore be declared as

       _H_I_S_T___E_N_T_R_Y _*_* tthhee__hhiissttoorryy__lliisstt;;

       The state of the History library is encapsulated into a  single  struc-
       ture:

       /*
        * A structure used to pass around the current state of the history.
        */
       typedef struct _hist_state {
         HIST_ENTRY **entries; /* Pointer to entry records. */
         int offset;           /* The current record. */
         int length;           /* Number of records in list. */
         int size;             /* Number of records allocated. */
         int flags;
       } HISTORY_STATE;

       If the flags member includes HHSS__SSTTIIFFLLEEDD, the history has been stifled.

       Place _s_t_r_i_n_g at the end of the history list.  The associated data field
       (if  any) is set to NNUULLLL.  If the maximum number of history entries has

       Make the history entry at offset _w_h_i_c_h have _l_i_n_e and  _d_a_t_a.   This  re-
       turns  the  old entry so the caller can dispose of any application-spe-

       These functions allow searching of the history list  for  entries  con-
       taining a specific string.  Searching may be performed both forward and
       backward  from  the  current  history  position.  The search may be _a_n_-
       _c_h_o_r_e_d, meaning that the string must match at the beginning of the his-

       Search the history for _s_t_r_i_n_g, starting at the current history  offset.
       If  _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n  is  less than 0, then the search is through previous en-
       tries, otherwise through subsequent entries.  If _s_t_r_i_n_g is found,  then
       the  current  history index is set to that history entry, and the value
       returned is the offset in the line of the entry where _s_t_r_i_n_g was found.

       Search the history for _s_t_r_i_n_g, starting at the current history  offset.
       The  search is anchored: matching lines must begin with _s_t_r_i_n_g.  If _d_i_-
       _r_e_c_t_i_o_n is less than 0, then the search is  through  previous  entries,

       Search for _s_t_r_i_n_g in the history list, starting at _p_o_s, an absolute in-

       If non-zero, timestamps are written to the history file, so they can be
       preserved between sessions.  The default value is 0, meaning that time-
       stamps  are  not saved.  The current timestamp format uses the value of

       If  that  variable does not have a value (the default), the history li-

       During tokenization, if this character is seen as the  first  character

       If  non-zero, the history expansion code implements shell-like quoting:
       single-quoted words are not scanned for the history expansion character
       or the history comment character, and double-quoted words may have his-
       tory expansion performed, since single quotes are  not  special  within
       double quotes.  The default value is 0.

       An  application may set this variable to indicate that the current line
       being expanded is subject to existing quoting.  If set  to  _',  history
       expansion  assumes that the line is single-quoted and inhibit expansion
       until it reads an unquoted closing single quote; if set to  _",  history
       expansion  assumes the line is double quoted until it reads an unquoted
       closing double quote.  If set to zero, the default,  history  expansion
       assumes  the  line is not quoted and treats quote characters within the

       done.   It  is  intended for use by applications like bbaasshh that use the
       history expansion character for additional purposes.  By default,  this
       variable is set to NNUULLLL.
