### Overview

Clink combines the native Windows shell cmd.exe with the powerful command line editing features of the GNU Readline library, which provides rich completion, history, and line-editing capabilities. Readline is best known for its use in the Unix shell Bash, the standard shell for Mac OS X and many Linux distributions.

For details, refer to the [Clink documentation](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/clink.html).

### Features

Here are some highlights of what Clink provides:

- The same line editing as Bash (from the [GNU Readline library](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) version 8.1).
- History persistence between sessions.
- Context sensitive completion;
  - Executables (and aliases).
  - Directory commands.
  - Environment variables.
- Context sensitive colored input text.
- Automatic suggestions from history and completions.
- New keyboard shortcuts;
  - Interactive completion list (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd>).
  - Incremental history search (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>).
  - Powerful completion (<kbd>Tab</kbd>).
  - Undo (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>).
  - Environment variable expansion (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>).
  - Doskey alias expansion (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>).
  - Scroll the screen buffer (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Up</kbd>, etc).
  - <kbd>Shift</kbd>+Arrow keys to select text, typing replaces selected text, etc.
  - (press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> for many more...)
- Directory shortcuts;
  - Typing a directory name followed by a path separator is a shortcut for `cd /d` to that directory.
  - Typing `..` or `...` is a shortcut for `cd ..` or `cd ..\..` (each additional `.` adds another `\..`).
  - Typing `-` or `cd -` changes to the previous current working directory.
- Scriptable autosuggest with Lua.
- Scriptable completion with Lua.
- Scriptable key bindings with Lua.
- Colored and scriptable prompt.
- Auto-answering of the "Terminate batch job?" prompt.

By default Clink binds <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> to display the current key bindings. More features can also be found in GNU's [Readline](https://tiswww.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html).

### Usage

There are several ways to start Clink.

1. If you installed the auto-run, just start `cmd.exe`.  Run `clink autorun --help` for more info.
2. To manually start, run the Clink shortcut from the Start menu (or the clink.bat located in the install directory).
3. To establish Clink to an existing `cmd.exe` process, use `<install_dir>\clink.exe inject`.

You can use Clink right away without configuring anything:

- Searchable [command history](#saved-command-history) will be saved between sessions.
- <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> will do match completion two different ways.
- Press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> to see a list of the current key bindings.
- Press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> followed by another key to see what command is bound to the key.

See [Getting Started](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/clink.html#getting-started) for information on getting started with Clink.

### Upgrading from Clink v0.4.9

The new Clink tries to be as backward compatible with Clink v0.4.9 as possible. However, in some cases upgrading may require a little bit of configuration work. More details can be found in the [Clink documentation](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/clink.html).

### Extending Clink

Clink can be extended through its Lua API which allows easy creation of context sensitive match generators, prompt filtering, and more. More details can be found in the [Clink documentation](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/clink.html).
